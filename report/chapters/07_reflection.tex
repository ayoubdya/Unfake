\label{ch:reflection}

This project significantly expanded my understanding of machine learning and NLP. I gained practical experience with fine-tuning transformers, handling class imbalance, and learned that traditional ML methods can outperform deep learning for certain tasks.

Key challenges included managing GPU memory constraints, handling noisy scraped data, and systematic model selection. If starting again, I would build an end-to-end prototype earlier and use experiment tracking tools like MLflow from the start.

The experience reinforced my interest in AI development and taught me that successful ML projects require thinking beyond just model accuracy, creating useful, accessible systems for end users is equally important.
