\chapter{Discussion and Analysis}
\label{ch:evaluation}

This chapter analyzes the results and examines the limitations of the UnFake system.

\section{Analysis of Model Performance}
\label{sec:performance_analysis}

The headline model achieved 74.69\% accuracy, which is solid performance for short text classification. The ROC-AUC score of 0.8317 indicates good discriminative ability between classes. The model shows higher precision for fake statements (0.85) but higher recall for real statements (0.80), suggesting conservative labeling of fake content.

The article model achieved 99.57\% accuracy due to the rich feature space provided by full-length articles. TF-IDF vectorization effectively captures distinguishing patterns between fake and real news articles.

\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

The main limitations of the system include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data bias:} The PolitiFact dataset primarily covers U.S. political statements, limiting generalization to other topics and regions.
    \item \textbf{Context independence:} Models classify based solely on text content, without considering source credibility or publication date.
    \item \textbf{Headline accuracy:} The 74.69\% accuracy means approximately 1 in 4 predictions may be incorrect.
    \item \textbf{Potential overfitting:} The article model's near-perfect accuracy may not generalize to diverse external datasets.
\end{itemize}

The system should be used as a tool to assist human judgment, not replace it.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:discussion_summary}

This chapter analyzed the results of the UnFake system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The headline model shows solid performance (74.69\%) for the challenging task of short statement classification
    \item The article model achieves excellent performance (99.57\%) for document-level classification
    \item The dual-model approach is validated by the different performance characteristics
    \item Important limitations exist regarding data bias, generalization, and explainability
    \item The system is best used as a tool to assist human judgment rather than make final determinations
\end{itemize}
